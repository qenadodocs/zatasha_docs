Privacy Policy for Zatasha
Effective Date: 05â€‘09â€‘2025

We developed Zatasha, a mobile game available on iOS and Android platforms. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the game.

1. Information We Collect
We do not collect personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, or phone number.

We only collect:

Player Country
This is obtained through a thirdâ€‘party IPâ€‘based geolocation service. We use this country information to:

Display the playerâ€™s country in their profile.

Rank players in regional leaderboards (future feature).

Detect and analyze the use of powerâ€‘up items in each country.

Make and tailor sales deals or promotional offers in the playerâ€™s country based on powerâ€‘up consumption patterns.

(Future) Deliver ads or promotional content tailored to the playerâ€™s country, including from direct advertising partners.

Note: We do not directly access or store your IP address â€” only the resulting country data returned by the third-party service. We also do not sell, share, or provide your IP address to advertising networks or other third parties.

2. Thirdâ€‘Party Services
Zatasha uses the following thirdâ€‘party services, which may collect data in accordance with their own privacy policies:

Unity Ads

Google AdMob

(Possibly) AppLovin or other ad networks

Facebook SDK (for Facebook login functionality)

IP Geolocation Services (used solely to determine player country)

Please refer to the respective privacy policies of these services for more information on how they handle user data.

3. Inâ€‘App Purchases
Zatasha includes optional inâ€‘app purchases. These transactions are handled by the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. We do not collect or store any payment or billing information.

4. Player Accounts
Players may create an account using Unity Authentication. This allows for saving progress, syncing data across devices, and identifying players across sessions. We do not collect personal information through this system.

5. Childrenâ€™s Privacy
Zatasha is a familyâ€‘friendly game suitable for all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

6. Planned Use of Country Data
In future updates, we may use the playerâ€™s country (determined via IPâ€‘based lookup) to:

Rank players in countryâ€‘based leaderboards.

Deliver ads or promotional content tailored to the playerâ€™s country, including from direct advertising partners.

Detect and analyze powerâ€‘up usage trends by country.

Negotiate and offer countryâ€‘specific sales deals or promotions based on player powerâ€‘up consumption patterns.

This usage will be limited to nonâ€‘personally identifiable geographic data.
