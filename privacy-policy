Privacy Policy for Zatasha
Effective Date: 06-06-2025
We developed Zatasha, a mobile game available on iOS and Android platforms. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the game.
1. Information We Collect
We do not collect personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, or phone number.

We only collect:
- Player Country: This is obtained through a third-party IP-based geolocation service. We use this country information to:
  - Display the playerâ€™s country in their profile.
  - Rank players in regional leaderboards (future feature).
  - (Future) Deliver ads or promotional content tailored to the playerâ€™s country, including from direct advertising partners.

Note: We do not directly access or store your IP address â€” only the resulting country data returned by the third-party service.
2. Third-Party Services
Zatasha uses the following third-party services, which may collect data in accordance with their own privacy policies:
- Unity Ads
- Google AdMob
- (Possibly) AppLovin or other ad networks
- Facebook SDK (for Facebook login functionality)
- IP Geolocation Services (used solely to determine player country)

Please refer to the respective privacy policies of these services for more information on how they handle user data.
3. In-App Purchases
Zatasha includes optional in-app purchases. These transactions are handled by the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. We do not collect or store any payment or billing information.
4. Player Accounts
Players may create an account using Unity Authentication. This allows for saving progress, syncing data across devices, and identifying players across sessions. We do not collect personal information through this system.
5. Childrenâ€™s Privacy
Zatasha is a family-friendly game suitable for all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.
6. Planned Use of Country Data
In future updates, we may use the playerâ€™s country (determined via IP-based lookup) to:
- Rank players in country-based leaderboards.
- Deliver ads or promotional content tailored to the playerâ€™s country, including from direct advertising partners.

This usage will be limited to non-personally identifiable geographic data.
7. Your Privacy Rights and Choices
